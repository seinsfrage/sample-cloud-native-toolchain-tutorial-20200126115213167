# Application used in Garage Method tutorial with Cloud Foundry

This application is a simple Node.js [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/) sample that you can extend. This sample code is used in a [course](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/content/course/garage-method-for-cloud-advocate) that explains how to configure a toolchain to use for cloud native development in DevOps Services and IBM Cloud. 

[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) is a methodology that aims to improve development and operational efficiencies while enhancing partnership with customers. DevOps is more than doing the same things faster; it establishes a delivery pipeline that spans from ideation to monitoring.  

To start working from a DevOps approach, use the DevOps Tutorial Toolchain. You'll get a DevOps toolchain in [IBM&reg; Cloud Continuous Delivery](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops) that is built by using best of breed tools, deployed to [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com), and has the foundation for test, scalability, and operations.

Use this sample application with a DevOps toolchain ([template](https://github.com/open-toolchain/cloud-native-toolchain-tutorial)) !
